/**
 * The record the core is handed, and the verdict it answers.
 *
 * Every rule a declared topology can be refused under is one function in
 * `flz_core::host::register::check`, and `validate` is the call that submits
 * to it: this SDK records what the author declared, hands it over, and renders
 * the answer as its own exception. Nothing here restates a rule the core
 * holds — a refusal added there reaches Node with no edit to this file.
 *
 * What is still refused here is what the record cannot carry: a closure the
 * declaration never names, which the core has nothing to judge.
 *
 * Static typing catches a wrong edge type before the program runs (a
 * `.into(tasklet)` whose producer's value the tasklet's declared input
 * does not accept is a compile error, pinned by the fixtures under
 * `types-tests/`); that backstop is unchanged and earlier than this one.
