/**
 * The desk's stream: trades in, each price compared with its symbol's recent
 * average, and an order started when a price jumps far enough above it.
 *
 * An unbounded operator runs for as long as the desk does. The exchange sends
 * other messages beside its trades and delivers several trades in one message,
 * so the wiring keeps the trade messages, splits each into its trades before
 * anything else sees them, drops what the desk does not follow, and routes the
 * rest to a cell per symbol.
 *
 * Four transforms on the wiring, then two tasklets, and one place output
 * leaves the desk.
 *
 * The entry names no codec, so each message arrives as the object its JSON
 * decodes to, with every field the exchange sent. The first `filter` keeps the
 * exchange's trade messages: the same connection also carries the confirmation
 * of every subscription, which has no trades to split. `flatMap` turns one
 * message into its trades, each routed on its own. The second `filter` keeps
 * the market orders. `keyBy` names the cell each trade belongs to, which is
 * what gives every symbol its own state and its own order of arrival, and it is
 * the last link before `into`, because it keys whatever the transforms above
 * it produced. The four run at the routing seam rather than as tasklets of
 * their own, which is why they must stay cheap and free of side effects.
 *
 * Only the first stage is keyed: a plain `into` leaves its consumer
 * single-cell, which is right for the second stage, since it keeps nothing per
 * symbol.
 *
 * `sealed()` states that the signals channel is where the desk's output ends.
 * It is purely type-level: the declared topology is the same without it, and
 * in TypeScript a later `into` on this chain does not compile.
