 * Starts a runner: a process that connects to the controller and serves your

 *
 * An operative is registered by module specifier rather than as an imported
 * value, because every dispatch loop imports the module itself. That is what
 * lets `.workers(n)` move dispatch onto worker threads without a rewrite.
 * Registering therefore imports, which is asynchronous, so each one is its own
 * `await` and a module that fails to load says so at the line that names it.

// Everything `flz operative` and `flz plugin` do is also a method here.
// Uncomment to drive this namespace from the application instead of from a
// terminal:
//
// const admin = runner.admin();
// await admin.startOperative('echo', { id: 'my_echo' });
// await admin.enablePlugin('writer', {
//   id: 'writer',
//   provider: 'operative_file_sink',
//   operative_id: 'my_echo',
//   opts: { path: 'echo-out.txt' },
//   hooks: [['on_output', {}]],
// });
// await admin.send('my_echo', 'hello world', 'in');
//
// docs/sdk/admin.md has the whole surface. An enforced controller refuses all
// of it until `flz role bind runner@default app default`.
