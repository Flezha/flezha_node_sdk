/**
 * The deployable unit. An operative declares the graph a message travels: the
 * entry channel it arrives on, the steps it passes through, and the channel its
 * result leaves on.
 *
 * `factoryId` is the operative's stable identity, and the name
 * `flz operative start` takes. The graph is checked as a whole when the runner
 * declares it, so one that cannot work is refused at startup.
 *
 * The entry names the text codec, so what `flz operative send --text` sends
 * arrives as a string. The sink names no codec, and a sink sends a string as its
 * UTF-8 bytes, so the output is the text itself.
